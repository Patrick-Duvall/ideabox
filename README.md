# Idea Box

This is a basic React App written off of [This Lesson](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-3/react-3-advanced-data-management.html) It implements a single page 'Idea Box' App with a form for creating ideas and buttons for deleting them. It keeps the Node backend up to date via fetch requests.

### To run the App locally
Install the Frontend, which will run on localhost:3000
```
git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-iii-ideabox
cd react-iii-ideabox
npm i
npm start
```
Install the [backend](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ideabox-api), NOT in the existing Idea Box repository in. It will run on localhost:3001 
```
git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ideabox-api.git ideabox-api
cd ideabox-api
npm i
node server.js
```
